##--- LN MINI-PROJECT 1 ---##
#-- Group 23 --#
- 90760 Nuno Laranjo 
- 92509 Leonor Veloso 

##--- OPTIONS TAKEN ---##
- the 'copy', 'skip', and 'mm2mmmm' transducers are pretty straightforward
- 'd2dd' and 'd2dddd' are non-deterministic
- 'date2year' just skips a pair of <digit><digit>/ until it copies 4 digits that represent the year
- 'R2A' is internally composed of sections that deal with particular letters; for instance, the state where it finds an L is connected to the sections that deal with I, V, and X, because they're the letters that can follow L on the right

##--- COMPOSITION OF THE BIGGER TRANSDUCERS ---##
- 'A2R' is simply an inversion of 'R2A'
